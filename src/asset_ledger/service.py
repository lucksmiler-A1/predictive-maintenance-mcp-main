"""
ISO 13374 Block 3 — State Detection (asset ledger service).

Orchestration shared by the tool modules, on the precedent of
``decision_support.diagnosis_pipeline``: a plain module inside the package
whose functions receive every dependency by argument. The :class:`LedgerStore`
and the data directory come from the caller (``config.get_ledger_dir()`` and
``config.DATA_DIR`` are read only at the tool boundary, at call time), so
nothing here binds a directory at import. No MCP, no ``models.py``, no
``signal_acquisition.repository``.

What ``load_signal`` does after a successful load, per signal that declares
an identity (:func:`record_measurements`; the asset view is read ONCE per
asset per batch and the global index once per batch):

1. The effective declaration (:func:`build_declaration`: the ``measurement``
   object plus ``sampling_rate``, ``signal_unit``, the effective
   ``raw_format`` and the decoded channel) and the file block
   (:func:`file_block`: location relative to the data directory with POSIX
   separators, or absolute with a flag; content digest; size) are
   fingerprinted against the latest declaration of the same
   ``measurement_id`` in the asset ledger: ``recorded`` (new for this
   asset), ``already_recorded`` (same fingerprint: no event) or
   ``superseded`` (a new ``measurement_recorded`` with
   ``declaration_version + 1`` naming the changed keys; a moved file is a
   supersession with ``changed == ["location"]``).
2. The ``measurement_recorded`` event is appended with
   :meth:`LedgerStore.append_versioned`: the events another process appended
   since the read are merged into the view BEFORE the decision, so two
   processes never assign the same version. If the global index says the
   id was recorded under ANOTHER asset (a mistyped ``asset_id`` later
   corrected), that ledger receives a superseding declaration naming the
   new asset, so its view lists the measurement under ``reattributed``
   without deleting anything; then the index entry is appended.
3. The health snapshot is computed from the signal, the effective
   declaration and the point's current declaration (or none) and appended
   as ``health_snapshot_computed`` only when its deterministic
   ``snapshot_id`` is not already in the view: a location-only or
   timestamp-only supersession yields the same id (nothing appended), an
   rpm correction a new one (the old snapshot stays).
4. Comparability is graded against the point alone (no reference context
   exists at load time) and reported, never stored.

A ledger failure never undoes a load: it is reported as
``ledger_status == "not_recorded"`` with the reason, and a retry is safe
because every event is deduplicated by content. A snapshot failure leaves
the measurement recorded (``snapshot_status == "failed"``); the next load
of the same file appends the missing snapshot and nothing else.

Re-processing (:func:`reprocess_stale_snapshots`, behind
``assess_asset_change(..., reprocess=True)``): a measurement of the point is
STALE when its view holds no snapshot with the current ``processing_id``
AND the ``context_digest`` of the current point declaration. Up to
``MAX_REPROCESS_PER_CALL`` stale measurements are re-processed per call, in
the order members of the active reference (declared baseline or the first N
slots), then the last K slots newest first, then the rest newest first
(the duplicates collapsed into another acquisition slot last), so the
reference and the last K slots carry the current lineage within two calls
whatever the length of the history and every measurement the point
declaration counts as stale is reached (the assessment moves onto the
current lineage once EVERY evaluated slot carries it; until then it uses
the older lineage that still covers the whole set, or reports
``processing_not_homogeneous`` when none does). The file is searched in
every location ever declared for the measurement, most recent first
(relative locations under
the data directory, contained by ``safe_resolve``; absolute ones as
recorded), its content hash is verified against the ledger before a single
sample is decoded, and the location used is reported. A file missing
everywhere or changed is a per-measurement ``not_reprocessable`` with the
reason; the old snapshot is never touched. Only derived events are
appended, each deduplicated by its deterministic ``snapshot_id``, so a
repeated call is idempotent.

Declarations and queries (behind the four ledger tools):

* :func:`declare_measurement_point` validates the declared context of a
  point (ids by the ledger grammar, closed vocabularies, the companion's
  free-text rule, positive numbers) and appends a
  ``measurement_point_declared`` event with ``declaration_version`` =
  current + 1 under the versioned-append lock; a declaration identical to
  the current version appends nothing and returns the current version. The
  response names the keys that changed and how many recorded measurements
  of the point now lack a snapshot with the current context and lineage
  (the staleness test shared with the re-processing), with the exact
  re-processing call as the remedy.
* :func:`declare_healthy_baseline` validates that every id is a recorded
  measurement of the point, that no two share an acquisition slot, and that
  each is comparable or qualified against the point and against the
  context built from the members themselves (the revalidation the
  assessment performs at query time), then appends a ``baseline_declared``
  event; an empty list with a note withdraws the active baseline.
* :func:`asset_index` reads at most ``max_assets`` ledgers and summarizes
  each (points, counts, latest lineage, baseline present, integrity);
  :func:`asset_history` reads ONE ledger and returns its summary, the last
  N measurements newest first with an indicator preview, the point
  declarations, the baselines, the reattributions and the integrity block.
