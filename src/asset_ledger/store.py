"""
Append-only asset ledger: event envelope, deterministic ids, canonical JSON,
:class:`LedgerStore` (locked append, tolerant read) and :func:`build_asset_view`.

ISO 13374 Block 3 (state detection), persistence layer. One JSONL file per
asset under the ledger directory (``config.get_ledger_dir()``), written only
by appending whole records and read by a tolerant binary reader that reports
every integrity problem instead of failing or hiding it. Nothing here leaves
the machine, nothing here computes a snapshot, nothing here imports MCP.

Event envelope (one JSON object per line, canonical form)::

    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "event_id": "<sha256 hex of the envelope without event_id/recorded_at>",
      "event_type": "measurement_recorded",
      "recorded_at": "2026-08-20T11:42:00.123456+00:00",   # server clock, UTC
      "asset_id": "P-101",
      "producer": {"name": "predictive-maintenance-mcp", "version": "0.13.0"},
      "payload": {...}
    }

``event_id`` excludes ``recorded_at``, so an identical retry yields the same
id and the reader absorbs it as a duplicate. The order of truth is the order
in the file; ``recorded_at`` (server) and the declared ``acquired_at`` inside
payloads stay separate, and every history ordering uses ``acquired_at``.

Payload key contracts (documented here, interpreted by :func:`build_asset_view`
and the upper layers; the reader validates only the envelope):

``measurement_point_declared``
    ``measurement_point_id``, ``declaration_version`` (1-based, per point),
    ``bearing_id``, ``fault_orders``, ``machine_group``, ``support_type``,
    ``machine_power_kw``, ``expected_signal_unit``, ``expected_sensor_id``,
    ``expected_direction``, ``nominal_rpm``, ``declared_by``, ``note``,
    ``changed`` (keys changed vs the previous version; for version 1, every
    key declared with a value).

``measurement_recorded``
    ``measurement_id``, ``measurement_point_id``, ``declaration_version``,
    ``declaration`` ({``asset_id``, ``measurement_point_id``, ``acquired_at``,
    ``timezone_declared``, ``timestamp_suspect``, ``rpm``, ``load``,
    ``operating_state``, ``sensor_id``, ``direction``, ``declared_by``,
    ``sampling_rate``, ``signal_unit``, ``raw_format``, ``channel_index``}),
    ``file`` ({``location``, ``location_is_relative``, ``content_sha256``,
    ``size_bytes``}), ``signal_id``, ``changed`` (keys changed vs the previous
    declaration; a supersession that moves the measurement to another asset
    has ``changed == ["asset_id"]`` and ``declaration.asset_id`` naming the
    new asset), ``locations`` (every location ever declared, most recent
    last).

``health_snapshot_computed``
    ``snapshot_id``, ``measurement_id``, ``measurement_point_id``,
    ``processing`` ({``processing_id``, ``algorithm_version``, ``params``,
    ``effective``, ``provenance``}), ``context_digest``, ``context`` (the
    resolved inputs the digest hashes: rpm and its source, bearing or
    orders, group, support, power, unit, direction),
    ``point_declaration_version``, ``indicators``, ``one_x``, ``bearing``,
    ``iso``, ``missing``.

``baseline_declared``
    ``baseline_id``, ``measurement_point_id``, ``measurement_ids`` (an empty
    list withdraws the baseline), ``members`` ([{``measurement_id``,
    ``declaration_version``, ``point_declaration_version``}]),
    ``declared_by``, ``note``, ``declared_at``.

Byte rules
    The record delimiter is the single byte 0x0A. The writer serializes
    compact canonical JSON with ``ensure_ascii=True`` (a declared deviation
    from RFC 8785, so U+2028 / U+2029 / U+0085 / carriage returns never
    appear literally) and writes ``line + b"\\n"`` with ONE ``os.write`` on an
    unbuffered, binary, ``O_APPEND`` descriptor (opened ``O_RDWR`` rather than
    ``O_WRONLY`` only so the same descriptor can read the last byte of the
    file), checking the byte count and calling ``fsync``. If the file does
    not end with 0x0A (a torn tail from a crash, a NUL run from a filesystem
    hiccup), the writer prepends one 0x0A to that same write, so the torn
    bytes stay isolated as exactly one unreadable record. The reader opens
    in binary, splits on 0x0A only, tolerates one trailing 0x0D per line,
    never uses ``splitlines()``, and treats a final segment without
    terminator as unreadable and NOT consumed (``end_offset`` stops before
    it). Integrity entries carry a record index, a reason code and ids that
    pass the ledger grammar, never record content, and the listing is
    capped at ``MAX_INTEGRITY_ISSUES`` (the counters are always exact).

Locking
    A sidecar ``<asset_id>.jsonl.lock`` next to each ledger (and
    ``_measurements.jsonl.lock`` next to the index) is locked with
    ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`` on POSIX and ``msvcrt.locking(LK_NBLCK)``
    on one byte at offset 0 on Windows, polled every ~10 ms up to a timeout
    measured with ``time.monotonic`` (5 s by default) and refused as
    :class:`LedgerLockTimeout`. An OS lock dies with its process, so there is
    no stale-lock cleanup and no need for one. Readers take no lock.

Invariants
    * No code path rewrites, truncates, renames or deletes a ledger file.
    * The sidecar lock file is never deleted, truncated or replaced: on
      POSIX the lock lives on the inode, and recreating the file would hand
      two processes two different locks on "the same" name.
    * The lock is held from the delta read to the append in
      :meth:`LedgerStore.append_versioned` (version assignment), around the
      write alone in :meth:`LedgerStore.append`, and never during any
      computation: the store computes nothing.
    * A ledger id is validated by ``signal_acquisition.measurement.
      validate_ledger_id`` and every path is resolved through
      ``path_safety.safe_resolve``; ids starting with ``_`` are reserved for
      the index; an id that differs from an existing ledger file only by
      letter case is refused on every operating system (NTFS and APFS would
      silently append to the other file).
    * The ledger directory is created lazily on the first append, never at
      import or construction time.
