"""
Measurement declaration contract of the companion ``<stem>_metadata.json``.

ISO 13374 Block 1 (data acquisition): the identity of a measurement, i.e.
"who measured what, where and when, on which asset", is DECLARED by the
producer of the file in a ``"measurement"`` object of the companion and
validated here with the same discipline as the raw-binary declaration:
explicit > companion > refusal with a remedy, nothing inferred from file
names or signal content.

Leaf module: only the standard library and :mod:`..path_safety`. The signal
repository calls it while preparing an entry (before insertion, so batches
stay all-or-nothing), the asset ledger imports its vocabularies, and the
documentation guard derives the declaration table from it.

Companion contract (the presence of the object activates it)::

    {
      "sampling_rate": 26585.3,                    # honored as today
      "signal_unit": "g",                          # honored as today
      "measurement": {
        "asset_id": "P-101",                       # required, ledger id
        "measurement_point_id": "motor_de_h",      # required, ledger id
        "acquired_at": "2026-08-20T13:42:00+02:00",  # required, ISO 8601
        "rpm": 1482, "load": 75, "operating_state": "loaded",
        "sensor_id": "STWIN_BOX_001", "direction": "horizontal",
        "declared_by": "adapter:stwinbox"
      }
    }

Free-form keys stay at the top level of the companion (they pass verbatim
into ``source_metadata``); inside the object only the fields listed in
``MEASUREMENT_FIELDS`` are accepted, so a misspelled field is refused
instead of silently dropped. ``sampling_rate`` and ``signal_unit`` stay
where they are today. Historical top-level keys such as ``shaft_speed``
(Hz) or ``load`` are never interpreted as measurement fields.
